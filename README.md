# Bat Loa Animation  
# WIP - Currently this is just a backup of the raw animation files  
(Though they are basically functional and free to use for anyone interested)

This is a port of the bat loa animation from WoW for Infinity EE engine games.  
Concept: Animation will be implemented via two animation slots, allowing to switch between walking and flying via special ability.
  
Todo:   
      Create animation sequences that are derived from other sequences. (e.g.: DE -> SL, TW)  
      Resize animation   
      Palette fixes (?)  
      Add sound set    
      Add proper *.ini files  
      Add WeiDU mod
