# Bat Loa Animation  
# WIP - Currently this is just a backup of the raw animation files  
(Though they are basically functional and free to use for anyone interested)

This is a port of the bat loa animation from WoW for Infinity EE engine games.  
Concept: Animation will be implemented via two animation slots, allowing to switch between walking and flying via special ability.
  
Todo:   
      Resize animation (?) 
      Palette fixes (?)    
      Add WeiDU mod
